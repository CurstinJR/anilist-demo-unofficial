# AniList Demo (Unofficial)

A fun project to learn about [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/) using [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react), explore [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) a bit more.

I am uploading to GitHub, incase local disappears.

## Things to learn

Maybe learn about [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), to manage the global state of the project application. Learn [React Routing](https://reactrouter.com/) if application requires.

# API

AniList is an anime platform where you can track, share, and discover your favorite anime and manga. Using [AniList API](https://anilist.co/graphiql).

[AniList Documentation](https://anilist.gitbook.io/anilist-apiv2-docs/overview/graphql/getting-started)

# Installation

If you wanna try it out yourself, you need [NodeJS & NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/). You can read the site's docs for your OS installation.

After that fork and clone the project. Navigate to the working directory. Open CLI/terminal and type

```
npm install
```

this will download all the dependencies, it might take awhile depending on your internet speed.

After download, in the same directory, start the server with the command

```
npm start
```

your default browser should open on `localhost:3000`.
